    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <p><em>"Put his favourite perfume on, Go play your video game"</em></p>
    <p> to me, this song is about surrender. finding joy in simply existing alongside a person you care about. no fighting, speculating, analzying. lana devotes herself to being with this man, even though he may not be fully present. He is playing his videogames, and she has found peace in being in the background of the moment. loving in the quiet moments  </p>
